# hello-space
This is just a test repository containing info about the stars I want to gaze with you in a night of August. Did you know that Jupyter owes a notebook? They say it's full of data about the meaning of life. It's full of love.

We are like stars forever shining on.
Touch me, I am losing shape.
Look, I am invisible, can you say my name
Catch me, I am almost there...
How can I be near, I am high-speed, I am everywhere.

We are flesh and we are free,
we are driftwood in the sea.
From the distance we are stars...
like there is a face on Mars.

You could not read my mind,
how I wanted you to hold me tight.
I could not save that night,
it was passing by at the speed of light

You and me, we never unveil mysteries...
Once we were shining - we never tried again
