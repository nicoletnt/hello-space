# hello-space
Did you know that Jupyter owes a notebook? They say it's full of data about the meaning of life. It's full of love...

Look, I am invisible, can you say my name?
Catch me, I am almost there...
How can I be near, I am high-speed, I am everywhere.
Sorry I could not save that night,
it was passing by at the speed of light...
