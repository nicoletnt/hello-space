# hello-space
This is just a test repository containing info about the stars I want to gaze with you. Did you know that Jupyter owes a notebook? They say it's full of data about the meaning of life. It's full of love...

Touch me, I am losing shape.
Look, I am invisible, can you say my name?
Catch me, I am almost there...
How can I be near, I am high-speed, I am everywhere.
Sorry I could not save that night,
it was passing by at the speed of light...
